		<h2>Hey there, I’m Colly. I graduated from UNSW Art & Design (formally and locally known as COFA), where I studied graphics, media design and environmental, spatial design practices. I’m currently the Head Designer at Event Hospitality & Entertainment in Sydney.</h2>

		<p>Specialising in both print and digital design, I am most passionate about building and maintaining strong brands. When I’m not working, you’ll find me practising hot yoga and exploring Sydney’s new and exciting places to eat.</p>
